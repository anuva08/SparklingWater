Sunita stood under the mango tree. It towered over her and gently swayed with the cool breeze. 
She stared at the delicious mangoes hanging from the branches. She tried to pluck a few so that her
mother could make some chutney for her.She heard a branch snap behind her. She turned behind to see
her friend Raju coming through the bushes.Raju called out her name and asked,"Won't you come to the
playground today?Rahul and Suman are waiting for us"."Fine" said Sunita. She spared a last glance at
the tree and ran away.
